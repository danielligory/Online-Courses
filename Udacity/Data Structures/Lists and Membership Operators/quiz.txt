Question 1
Quiz: List Indexing
Use list indexing to determine how many days are in a particular month based on the integer variable month, and store that value in the integer variable num_days. For example, if month is 8, num_days should be set to 31, since the eighth month, August, has 31 days.

Remember to account for zero-based indexing!
