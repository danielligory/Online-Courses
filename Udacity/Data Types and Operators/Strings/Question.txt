Question 1 

Quiz: Fix the Quote
The line of code in the following quiz will cause a SyntaxError, thanks to the misuse of quotation marks. First run it with Test Run to view the error message. Then resolve the problem so that the quote (from Henry Ford(opens in a new tab)) is correctly assigned to the variable ford_quote.




Question 2

We’ve already seen that the type of objects will affect how operators work on them. What will be the output of this code?

coconut_count = "34"
mango_count = "15"
tropical_fruit_count = coconut_count + mango_count
print(tropical_fruit_count)

Answer - 3415 (will be printed as a string)




Question 3
In this programming quiz, you’re going to use what you’ve learned about strings to write a logging message for a server.

You’ll be provided with example data for a user, the time of their visit and the site they accessed. You should use the variables provided and the techniques you’ve learned to print a log message like this one (with the username, url, and timestamp replaced with values from the appropriate variables):

Yogesh accessed the site http://petshop.com/pets/reptiles/pythons at 16:20.

Question 4

Quiz: len()
Use string concatenation and the len() function to find the length of a certain movie star's actual full name. Store that length in the name_length variable. Don't forget that there are spaces in between the different parts of a name!
