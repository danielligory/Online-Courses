Quiz: String Methods Coding Practice
Below, we have a string variable that contains the first verse of the poem, If by Rudyard Kipling(opens in a new tab). Remember, \n is a special sequence of characters that causes a line break (a new line).

verse = "If you can keep your head when all about you\n  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n  But make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n  Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, don’t give way to hating,\n  And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:"
