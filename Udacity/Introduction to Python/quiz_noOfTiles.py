#Quiz: Calculate
#In this quiz you're going to do some calculations for a tiler.
#Two parts of a floor need tiling.
#One part is 9 tiles wide by 7 tiles long, the other is 5 tiles wide by 7 tiles long.
#Tiles come in packages of 6.


# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles are needed.
tiles_needed = (9*7) + (5*7)
total_tiles = 17*6
print(tiles_needed)

# Fill this in with an expression that calculates how many tiles will be left over.
print(total_tiles - tiles_needed)
