Quiz: Create an HTML List
Write some code, including a for loop, that iterates over a list of strings and creates a single string, html_str, which is an HTML list. For example, if the list is items = ['first string', 'second string'], printing html_str should output:

<ul>
<li>first string</li>
<li>second string</li>
</ul>
That is, the string's first line should be the opening tag <ul>. Following that is one line per element in the source list, surrounded by <li> and </li> tags. The final line of the string should be the closing tag </ul>.
