Question 1

Imagine an air traffic control program that tracks three variables, altitude, speed, and propulsion which for a particular airplane have the values specified below.

altitude = 10000
speed = 250
propulsion = "Propeller"
For each of the following boolean expressions, work out whether it evaluates to True or False and match the correct value.

altitude < 1000 and speed > 100

False

(propulsion == "Jet" or propulsion == "Turboprop") and speed < 300 and altitude > 20000

False

not (speed > 400 and propulsion == "Propeller")

True

(altitude > 500 and speed > 100) or not propulsion == "Propeller"

True
