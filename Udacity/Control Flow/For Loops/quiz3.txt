Quiz: Tag Counter
Write a for loop that iterates over a list of strings, tokens, and counts how many of them are XML tags(opens in a new tab). XML is a data language similar to HTML. You can tell if a string is an XML tag if it begins with a left angle bracket "<" and ends with a right angle bracket ">". Keep track of the number of tags using the variable count.

You can assume that the list of strings will not contain empty strings.
