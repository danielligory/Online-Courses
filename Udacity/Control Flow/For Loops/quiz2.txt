Quiz Question

Let's say instead of creating a new list, we want to modify the names list itself with the changes and write the following code. What would this do?

names = ["Joey Tribbiani", "Monica Geller", "Chandler Bing", "Phoebe Buffay"]

for name in names:
    name = name.lower().replace(" ", "_")

print(names)


-- The printed output for the names list will look exactly like it did in the line
